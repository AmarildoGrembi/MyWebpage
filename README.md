# MyWebpage
getting comfortable with html,css and javascript

This is something that i was working on way back when i didn't know anything about Web development. I started creating something simple as a WebPage so i could master the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript that i was constantly learning day by day.

I must say it is something simple and ugly, but it is good to see at which point i was when i first started.
